# ART - Automated RNA-sequencing Tool
ART is a biostatistics tool that automates the RNA-sequencing pipeline, allowing a researcher with minimal experience in data science, coding, and biostatistics to analyze and visualize bulk RNA-sequencing data.

### Description of Problem/Opportunity

RNA sequencing is a sequencing technique used ubiquitously in biomedical research today. It allows researchers to determine the number of RNA, protein-coding transcripts that exist inside a cell. This provides researchers with an intracellular view of how perturbations in biological systems can affect cellular function and behavior. 

While the bench-side technique is relatively simple, the analysis of the data is tedious and often requires outsourcing the raw sequencing (.FASTQ) files to a biostatistician. This creates a disconnect between the researcher and data scientist: neither is able to fully articulate their needs to the other and information is lost in the process. The biologist is often at the whim of whatever the biostatistician produces, leaving many questions unanswered. 

### Proposed Solution/Approach

### Project Outline and Timeline
What are the steps to complete the project? State your milestones and the dates you want to complete them. 

## Goals of project 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1
### Goal 2

## Project Metrics 
**Due October 26, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1
### Metric 2

## Self-Evaluation
**Due December 8, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.
