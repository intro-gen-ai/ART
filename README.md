# ART - Automated RNA-sequencing Tool
ART is a biostatistics tool that automates the RNA-sequencing pipeline, allowing a researcher with minimal experience in data science, coding, and biostatistics to analyze and visualize bulk RNA-sequencing data.

## Project Proposal 

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
RNA sequencing is a sequencing technique used ubiquitously in biomedical research today. It allows researchers to determine the number of RNA, protein-coding transcripts that exist inside a cell. This provides researchers with an intracellular view of how perturbations in biological systems can affect cellular function and behavior. 

While the bench-side technique is relatively simple, the analysis of the data is tedious and often requires outsourcing the raw sequencing (.FASTQ) files to a biostatistician. This creates a disconnect between the researcher and data scientist: neither is able to fully articulate their needs to the other and information is lost in the process. The biologist is often at the whim of whatever the biostatistician produces, leaving many questions unanswered. 

### Proposed Solution/Approach
The Automated RNA-sequencing Tool (ART) is designed to bridge the gap between biologists and data scientists, enabling those with minimal experience in data science and biostatistics to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize bulk RNA-sequencing data. The key components of the solution include:

**User-Friendly Interface:** A graphical interface that allows users to upload raw sequencing (.FASTQ) files and choose the desired analyses without having to write any code.

**Automated Data Processing:** ART will be equipped with pre-configured pipelines to process raw data, perform quality control, and map reads to a reference genome.

**Integrated Analysis Modules:** Users can select from a range of analyses, including differential expression, pathway analysis, and gene ontology, among others.

**Visualization Suite:** ART will offer a suite of visualization tools that enable users to generate plots and graphs from their data, aiding in easier interpretation and presentation.

**Collaboration and Reporting:** Users can generate comprehensive reports of their analyses and share them with collaborators or publish them in journals.

## Goals of project 

### Goal 1 
Enable researchers to analyze RNA-sequencing data without the need for specialized knowledge in biostatistics or programming, thereby reducing the reliance on external biostatisticians.
### Goal 2
Facilitate a comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing data, from raw data processing to in-depth analysis and visualization, all within a single integrated platform.
### Goal 3
Promote better communication and understanding between biologists and data scientists by offering transparent and understandable analytical methods and results.
### Goal 4
Reduce the time and costs associated with RNA-seq data analysis by providing an automated and efficient solution.

## Project Metrics 

### Metric 1
Time Efficiency: Measure the time it takes for ART to process and visualize a standard RNA-sequencing dataset and compare it to the average time taken by a biostatistician. The tool should reduce the analysis time by at least 50%.

### Metric 2
Accuracy: Compare the results generated by ART with those produced by a biostatistician for the same dataset. The results should have a concordance rate of at least 95%.

### Metric 3
User Satisfaction: Conduct a survey among a group of beta testers to assess their satisfaction with the tool. Aim for an average satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 or high
